# D3 Linked Graphs

This repository contains a html file (with Javascript embedded) that contains two simple visualizations using the D3 library based on the Income Evaluation Dataset. Each of the visualizations visually encodes three variables (i.e., columns of the data table) in the dataset.

The two visualizations are interactively linked together. When a user is hovering over an element in one visualization (e.g., a dot in a scatterplot), the corresponding visual element in the other visualization (e.g., a bar in a bar chart) is highlighted (e.g., with a change of color or dot size), and vice versa. The graphs are rendered at real-time by reading the csv file containing the dataset and making needed calculations.
